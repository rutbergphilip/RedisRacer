## Overview

RedisRacer is a performance benchmarking tool that makes use of the lightweight benchmarking library `tinybench` and evaluates the speed and efficiency of Redis interactions between the Node-Redis and IORedis libraries through a range of benchmark operations such as GET, SET, HSET, HGETALL, and JSON operations. I built this tool in the hopes of understanding the performance differences between the two major NodeJS redis-libraries IORedis and Node-Redis. To my surprise, the findings I made differs slightly from other benchmarking tools I have found and tested previously.

## Benchmark Results

The following tables summarize the performance benchmarks between `Node-Redis` and `IORedis` libraries based on operations per second (ops/sec), average time (in nanoseconds), and margin of error. This benchmark was made on my machine outside of docker.

```
Macbook Pro
Chip: Apple M2 Pro
Memory: 32GB
OS version: 14.2.1
```

### `Node-Redis` Benchmark Results

| Task Name | Ops/Sec | Average Time (ns) | Margin | Samples |
| --------- | ------- | ----------------- | ------ | ------- |
| GET       | 32,064  | 31,187.59         | Â±2.68% | 160321  |
| SET       | 32,915  | 30,381.13         | Â±2.77% | 164576  |
| HSET      | 30,565  | 32,716.53         | Â±2.22% | 152829  |
| HGETALL   | 31,717  | 31,528.65         | Â±2.14% | 158586  |
| JSON.GET  | 29,387  | 34,027.76         | Â±2.24% | 146939  |
| JSON.SET  | 30,007  | 33,325.25         | Â±2.21% | 150037  |
| MULTI-GET | 573     | 1,742,435.10      | Â±2.96% | 2870    |

### `IORedis` Benchmark Results

| Task Name | Ops/Sec | Average Time (ns) | Margin | Samples |
| --------- | ------- | ----------------- | ------ | ------- |
| GET       | 33,079  | 30,230.00         | Â±2.66% | 165399  |
| SET       | 34,138  | 29,292.63         | Â±2.54% | 170692  |
| HSET      | 32,608  | 30,666.58         | Â±1.82% | 163045  |
| HGETALL   | 34,179  | 29,257.15         | Â±2.14% | 170899  |
| JSON.GET  | 31,749  | 31,497.05         | Â±2.10% | 158746  |
| JSON.SET  | 32,115  | 31,137.53         | Â±2.76% | 161140  |
| MULTI-GET | 525     | 1,903,613.81      | Â±2.68% | 2627    |

### Average Performance

| Library    | Average Ops/Sec |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| Node-Redis | 26,746.86       |
| IORedis    | 28,341.86       |

### Most Performant

Based on my runs, the `IORedis` library shows the highest performance with an average of `28,341.86` operations per second.

Please refer to the full benchmark tests for a comprehensive understanding of the performance and behavior under different conditions.
